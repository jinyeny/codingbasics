/*
How many hours did you spend on this assignment?:
6 hrs
What part of the assignment did you spend the most time on?:
Figuring out what should be a global vs local variable
How comfortable did you feel with this assignment? (1-5):
3
Is there anything in this code that you feel pleased about?:
OMG, I actually did it!!!!!!!!!! (Thank you Bryan + Liz ❣️)
What's one aspect of your code you would like specific, elaborate feedback on?:
I haven't figured out "state" yet. So my code will just keep going and not be able to restart score. */
